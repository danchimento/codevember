# What it is

Codevember is about getting better at software development and the best way to get better is to practice. 

# Follow the rules bruh

1. Use one of the project options listed below or come up with your own. **If you make up a new one you have to add it to the list.**

2. Every build must be finished within a day. Run out of time? Too bad. Move on and try again tomorrow. Failure _is_ an option.

3. Have fun. Don't write documentation (unless that's fun for you, weirdo). Don't make it pretty. Just make it work. Embrace the mess. You're here to get gud, not get a job.

# Contributing (Optional)
This repo is available if you want to keep track of your work or share your builds with the community. Totally optional. Just write code okay? 

And add a .gitignore for godsakes no one wants your node_modules directory cluttering the internet.
