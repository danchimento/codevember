# What?

Codevember is about getting better at software development and the best way to get better is to practice. 

# Follow the rules bruh

1. Use one of the project options listed below or come up with your own. **If you make up a new one you have to add it to the list. **

2. Every build must be finished within a day. Run out of time? Too bad. Move on and try again tomorrow. Failure _is_ an option.

3. Have fun. Don't write documentation (unless that's fun for you, weirdo). Don't make it pretty. Just make it work. Embrace the mess. You're here to get good, not get a job.
